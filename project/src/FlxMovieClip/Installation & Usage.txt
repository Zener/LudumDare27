USAGE
--------------------
--------------------

To create a new FlxMovieClip and add it to the state:
--------------------
var fmc:FlxMovieClip = new FlxMovieClip(x,y);
fmc.loadMovieClip(movieclip, width, height);
add(fmc);

To create a new looping FlxMovieClip and add it to the state:
--------------------
fmc.loadMovieClip(movieclip, width, height, true);

To create a new FlxMovieClip that starts playing automatically and add it to the state:
--------------------
fmc.loadMovieClip(movieclip, width, height, false, true);

To create a new FlxMovieClip that calls a function at the end of its animation and add it to the state:
--------------------
fmc.loadMovieClip(movieclip, width, height, false, false, function);

To start/stop MovieClip:
--------------------
fmc.playing = true;
fmc.playing = false;


FAQ

Who made this?

What's the point of this?
--------------------
To draw a Flash MovieClip as an FlxSprite, so you can use it in Flixel like any other FlxSprite.

Should I use this instead of FlxSprites or FlxG.stage.addChild()/addChildAt()?
--------------------
NO!! Flixel is designed to be used with pixel art, not vector art.
Using FlxMovieClips is more processing intensive than the other methods. Don't use this if you can avoid it!

Why not just use FlxSprites instead of MovieClips?
--------------------
It's true that MovieClips can be rendered as sprite sheets and imported into Flixel. This should be the first thing you try!
However, sometimes FlxSprites just don't meet the requirements - e.g. complicated menus with lots of animations, or long high-quality cutscenes that are simply too large to render as a sprite sheet.

Why not just use FlxG.stage.addChild()/addChildAt()?
--------------------
It's true that addChild can be used to draw a MovieClip on top of or below the Flixel camera. This should be the second thing you try!
However, sometimes addChild just doesn't meet the requirements - e.g. if you want the Flixel cursor to appear on top, or draw the MovieClip at a specific order within the Flixel display list.

Can I really do everything I can do with a Flash MovieClip with an FlxSprite?
--------------------
No! Some method and properties are unsupported.
Supported: x, y, angle, scale, offset, velocity, acceleration, antialiasing, visible, flash movieclip animations
Unsupported: alpha, blend, replaceColor, stamp, drawLine, fill, active, flixel animations

Can I use this in my game?
--------------------
Yes. Free of charge.
Please thank me in the credits and link back to me if possible - but this is not a requirement!
